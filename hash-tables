1. What is a hash table?
    A. A hash table is a type of data structure that stores key-value pairs. Each key must be unique so that it can be used
    to retrieve it's value. 

2. What is hashing?
    A. Hashing is the process of converting a string (a key) to a numerical index (hash code). 

3. How does a hash table store data?
    A. The hash code is used as a key to determine where the key-value pairs will be placed within its internal array. 

4. How are hash tables and objects different?
    A.

5. Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:
    A list of pets and their unique names. --object
    The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend. --object
    The name and location of every company in a given city. --hash table
    All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual. --hash table
    The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact. --object

6. Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.
    A.  Create HashMapCustomer
        Store each phone number(key) into HashMapCustomer and associate it with the customers name and address (value)
        Retrieve customer info (value) by finding the key equal to the phone number 

7. Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.
    A.  Create HashMapInventory
        Store each item number (key) into HashMapInventory and associate it with the item information (value: description, price, quantity on hand)
        Retrieve item info by finding the key equal to the item number
        Adjust quantity on hand when an item is purchased

8. Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.
    A.  Create HashMapPublisher
        Create HashMapPublication
        Store each publisher (key) into HashMapPublisher and associate it with it's publication date
        Store each publication date (key) into HashMapPublication and associate it with it's publisher
        Retrieve publication info from HashMapPublisher by finding the key equal to the publisher
        Retrieve publisher info from HashMapPublication by finding the key equal to the publication
