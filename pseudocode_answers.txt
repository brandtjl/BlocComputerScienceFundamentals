Short Answer
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
    A. Pseudocode helps programmers to develop algorithms. It's a way to outline what code should do without having to use a specific
    languages syntax. It is a way to brainstorm before doing any formal coding. 

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
    A. It will not run. Could generate a plethera of errors, perhaps. 

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
    A.  input first number
        input second number
        compare both numbers and store the greater number in var greaterNum
        return greaterNum

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
    A.  set var number to 1
        while the number is less than or equal to 100
            print number
            add 1 to number
        endwhile

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
    A.  input a string
        input phonebook array
        for each element of phonebook 
            if phonebook[i] === string  
                return phonebook entry
            endif
        endfor

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
